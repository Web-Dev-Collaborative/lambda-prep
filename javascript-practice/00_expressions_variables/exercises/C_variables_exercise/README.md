# Very Able

_Variables_ allow programmers to store values to be used later in their code. The value that a
variable contains can change throughout the runtime of a program.

Before you start this exercise, make sure you have watched the lecture first.

## 0. Do you speak the language?

Create a folder named `variables_exercise`. Create a file named `zero.js` inside of it. Predict what
the `console.log`s in the code below will print out:

```js
let location = "Brooklyn, " + "NY";
console.log(location);

let quantity = 4 * 5 + 1;
console.log(quantity);
```

Test your predictions by typing the code into the `zero.js` file; don't copy and paste. Run it to
check your guess.

## 1. What's changed? What hasn't?

Create a new file named `one.js` inside of the `variables_exercise` folder. Predict what the
`console.log`s in the code below will print out:

```js
let word = "bye";
console.log(word + " felicia");
console.log(word);

let num = 10;
num = num * 2;
console.log(num);

let bottlesOfBeer = 99;
let around = bottlesOfBeer - 1;
console.log(around);
console.log(bottlesOfBeer);
```

Test your predictions by typing the code into the `one.js` file. Run it.

## 2. How about this?

Create a new file named `two.js` inside of the `variables_exercise` folder. Predict what the
`console.log`s in the code below will print out:

```js
let apple;
console.log(apple);

apple = 5;
console.log(apple);

apple + 1;
console.log(apple);

apple += 1;
console.log(apple);

let banana = apple;
console.log(banana);

banana = banana / 2;
console.log(banana);

console.log(apple);
```

Test your predictions by typing the code into the `two.js` file. Run it.

## 3. Did you forget about modulo?

Create a new file named `three.js` inside of the `variables_exercise` folder. Predict what the
`console.log`s in the code below will print out:

```js
let qty = 15 % 4;
console.log(qty);

let num = 38 + 3;
num++;
console.log(num + " is a great number");

let isNumEven = num % 2 === 0;
console.log(num + " is even? " + isNumEven);

let isQtyEven = qty % 2 === 0;
console.log(qty + " is even? " + isQtyEven);
```

## 4. So you can code, but do you have good taste in cinema?

Create a new file named `four.js` inside of the `variables_exercise` folder. Create two variables:

- `movie`, assigned to the string title of your favorite movie
- `views`, assigned to the number of times you watched that movie

When executed, the program should print the message
`I watched <movie> about <views> number of times`.
