# Building It Up By Breaking It Down

Three reasons why you'll improve as a programmer. You won't believe number 3!

If you get stuck during this exercise, reference this walkthrough. Only watch enough of the
walkthrough to get yourself unstuck, then pause the video and pick up the exercise on your own.

I'm going to make you practice so much that you wish you had never subscribed.

## Instructions

Create a new folder named `C_decomposing_problems_exercise`, this is where you'll save all of your
files. Solve each of the prompts below. Create a new file for each prompt and execute your code to
see if it matches the example output.

### lalaLanguage

Create a `lala-language.js` file and solve the function below:

```js
// Write a function `lalaLanguage` that accepts a sentence string as an argument. The function should
// return a new sentence where words longer that 3 characters are modified. Modified words should have
// each vowel followed by 'l' and the same vowel repeated again. See the examples.

console.log(lalaLanguage('this is pretty strange')); // 'thilis is preletty stralangele'
console.log(lalaLanguage('can you speak our language')); // 'can you spelealak our lalangulualagele'
```

### pickPerfectSquares

Create a `pick-perfect-squares.js` file and solve the function below:

```js
// Write a function `pickPerfectSquares` that accepts an array of numbers as an argument. The function 
// should return an array containing only the elements that are perfect squares. A perfect square
// is a number that can result from multiplying some number by itself.
//
// For example, 4 is a perfect square because 2 * 2 = 4
// For example, 81 is a perfect square because 9 * 9 = 81

console.log(pickPerfectSquares([6, 4, 81, 21, 36])); // [4, 81, 36]
console.log(pickPerfectSquares([100, 24, 144])); // [100, 144]
console.log(pickPerfectSquares([30, 25])); // [25]
```

### censorSentence

Create a `censor-sentence.js` file and solve the function below:

```js
// Write a function `censorSentence(sentence, targetWords)` that accepts a sentence string and an array
// of target words as arguments. The function should return a new sentence where any target words 
// have all of their characters replaced with '*'s.

console.log(censorSentence('where the heck is my celery', ['heck', 'celery'])); 
// 'where the **** is my ******'

console.log(censorSentence('why you little sweetheart', ['sweetheart', 'salad'])); 
// 'why you little **********'
```
