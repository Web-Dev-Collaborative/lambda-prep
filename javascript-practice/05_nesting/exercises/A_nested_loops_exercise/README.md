# Loop the Loop

_Nested Loops_ are when we write a loop within the body of another loop. The pattern can be useful
to generate "pairs" of things.

Before you start this exercise, make sure you have watched the lecture first.

If you get stuck during this exercise, reference this walkthrough. Only watch enough of the
walkthrough to get yourself unstuck, then pause the video and pick up the exercise on your own.

If you are comfortable with single loops, then you'll find nested loops pretty intuitive. Good thing
we practiced single loops a ton already.

## 0. Reading Nested Loops.

Create a new folder named `A_nested_loops`, this is where you'll save all of your files. Predict
what would print when executing each of the snippets below. Test your prediction by typing the
snippet into their own files and executing the program. Don't copy and paste.

Write the below code into a file named `snippet-1.js`. Make a prediction for what it will print. Run
it.

```js
// snippet 1
for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
    console.log(i, j);
  }
}
```

Write the below code into a file named `snippet-2.js`. Make a prediction for what it will print. Run
it.

```js
// snippet 2
for (let n = 0; n < 2; n++) {
  console.log("n=" + n);
  for (let m = 0; m < 5; m++) {
    console.log("   m=" + m);
  }
  console.log("n=" + n);
}
```

Write the below code into a file named `snippet-3.js`. Make a prediction for what it will print. Run
it.

```js
// snippet 3
let friends = ["philip", "abby", "phelipe", "simcha"];

for (let i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < friends.length; j++) {
    console.log(friends[i], friends[j]);
  }
}
```

Write the below code into a file named `snippet-4.js`. Make a prediction for what it will print. Run
it.

```js
// snippet 4
let locations = ["flatbush", "williamsburg", "bushwick", "greenpoint"];

for (let i = 0; i < locations.length; i++) {
  for (let j = i + 1; j < locations.length; j++) {
    console.log(locations[i], locations[j]);
  }
}
```

Write the below code into a file named `snippet-5.js`. Make a prediction for what it will print. Run
it.

```js
// snippet 5
let colors = ["red", "purple", "orange"];

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  let colorStr = colors[i];
  console.log(colorStr);

  for (let j = 0; j < colorStr.length; j++) {
    let char = colorStr[j];
    console.log(char);
  }
}
```

## 1. Writing Nested Loops.

In this section of the exercise you'll be prompted to write a function to accomplish a specific
task. Read the description and look at the example output to figure out what should be implemented
within the function. Write each function to a separate file in the `A_nested_loops_exercise` folder
and test your work by running the file.

### pairPrint

Create a `pair-print.js` file and solve the function below:

```js
// Write a function `pairPrint` that accepts an array as an argument. The function should print
// all unique pairs of elements in the array. The function doesn't need to return any value. It
// should just print to the terminal.

pairPrint(["artichoke", "broccoli", "carrot", "daikon"]);
// prints
//  artichoke - broccoli
//  artichoke - carrot
//  artichoke - daikon
//  broccoli - carrot
//  broccoli - daikon
//  carrot - daikon

pairPrint(["apple", "banana", "clementine"]);
// prints
//  apple - banana
//  apple - clementine
//  banana - clementine
```

### printCombinations

Create a `print-combinations.js` file and solve the function below:

```js
// Write a function `printCombinations`that accepts two arrays as arguments. The function should
// print all combinations of the elements generated by taking an element from the first array and
// and an element from the second array. The function doesn't need to return any value. It
// should just print to the terminal.

let colors = ["gray", "cream", "cyan"];
let clothes = ["shirt", "flannel"];
printCombinations(colors, clothes);
// prints
//  gray shirt
//  gray flannel
//  cream shirt
//  cream flannel
//  cyan shirt
//  cyan flannel

printCombinations(["hot", "cold"], ["soup", "tea"]);
// prints
//  hot soup
//  hot tea
//  cold soup
//  cold tea
```

### twoSum

Create a `two-sum.js` file and solve the function below:

```js
// Write a function `twoSum(numbers, target)` that accepts an array of numbers and a target number
// as an argument. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a pair
// of distinct elements in the array that sum to the target.

console.log(twoSum([2, 3, 5, 9], 7)); // true
console.log(twoSum([2, 3, 5, 9], 4)); // false
console.log(twoSum([6, 3, 4], 10)); // true
console.log(twoSum([6, 5, 1], 10)); // false
```
